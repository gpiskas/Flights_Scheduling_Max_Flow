Flights Scheduling using Max Flow
===========================

A simplified real-world problem regarding flights scheduling solved using max flow concepts. The core of this project is the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

Given a list of individual flights (FROM DEP_TIME TO ARR_TIME) and the number of available planes, the algorithm depicts the flights as a graph based on chronological order and tries to find the optimal combination of flights that can be consecutively completed using the minimum number of planes. The above is achieved using the max flow concept from the field of graph theory. 

A relevant example exists in the project for you to run and experiment.

The repository structure is based on the Eclipse IDE project layout. You can import the code there and start coding!
